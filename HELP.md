# Getting Started

To start server, run DemoApplication.main()

### history

To build this and get it deployed on render, I followed:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kQ3ELo49Y
* https://start.spring.io/
* https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/

The only thing that was missing, I think, was a .gitignore file!
