# Getting Started

To start server, run DemoApplication.main()
If the ScoresController is present, it'll demand a DATABASE_URL env var.  You can set it by editing the run configuration.  

Note that your database connection URL can't be in the normal form that elephantsql, etc, apply  - not postgres://... - rather you'll need to re-write it into a form as follows:
```
//note: you'll have to substitute real values for the placeholders in CAPS below.
jdbc:postgresql://HOSTNAME/DBNAME?user=DBUSERNAME&password=DBPASSWORD
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=yourname

### Database? that's too much work for now

If you don't want to faff with database stuff at all for now, just delete `ScoresController.java`.

### history

To build this and get it deployed on render, I followed:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kQ3ELo49Y
* https://start.spring.io/
* https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/

The only thing that was missing, I think, was a .gitignore file!
